# Make your Microsoft Teams always show Available/Green when you are not in front of the PC

## Just run the application
(Make sure the MS Teams is running) or You can use any other running application which has a window, you can supply the process name (get the process name from the Task manager), provide the name as 2nd argument to the application using the command prompt or any shell you like.
```bash
ScreenActive.exe 4000 teams
# 1st argument - Delay amount 
# 2nd argument - The process name.
```

This application does nothing but Maximizes/Minimizes the provided process window within a given time interval. In this way it prevents the MS teams going away status. This trick works prefectly and I've used it personally.
